# ska_connect_dart

Dart support package for the [Connect](https://connect.build) protocol. This is not intended for direct use, but for use with generated code. It currently supports unary requests and the http client can be customized by implementing a common interface.

This package is published as `ska_connect_dart` in case there is ever an official version of `connect_dart`.
